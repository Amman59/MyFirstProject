# MyFirstProject
Test project to learn features of Github.

The first thing I want to do is to make a simple print statement, which in itself may seem like a pointless endevour, due to the fact that I have manually inputted the output, but this shall bear importance for 2 reasons.The first is that it will allow me to learn how to run, debug and push code onto a repository, and the other is that it will allow me to use a similar function at a later stage to output data which I have not manually input as text within the print function itself.

The second thing that I wnated to do is to add in the most basic math command possible. By assigning 2 numbers I want to create an output that wasnt manually typed in.Easy enough to write this and execute the function.

Next I want to try something that I read about recently which is called 'BubbleSort' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). This Will take an array and sort it in order which has the potential to make visualising data much easier.Upon reading the afformentioned link, I can see there is a function called Timsort which I will will use.
    I wrote the algorithm to correctly sort a simple array, and during the debugging phase there was an issue in that Tuples can not be modified the same way that lists are, so I rectified this by converting array E into a list by name of C.

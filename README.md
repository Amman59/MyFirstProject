# MyFirstProject
Test project to learn features of Github.

The first thing I want to do is to make a simple print statement, which in itself may seem like a pointless endeavour, due to the fact that I have manually inputted the output, but this shall bear importance for 2 reasons.The first is that it will allow me to learn how to run, debug and push code onto a repository, and the other is that it will allow me to use a similar function at a later stage to output data which I have not manually input as text within the print function itself.

The second thing that I wanted to do is to add in the most basic math command possible. By assigning 2 numbers I want to create an output that wasnt manually typed in.Easy enough to write this and execute the function.

Next I want to try something that I read about recently which is called 'BubbleSort' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort). This Will take an array and sort it in order which has the potential to make visualising data much easier.Upon reading the afformentioned link, I can see there is a function called Timsort which I will will use.
    I wrote the algorithm to correctly sort a simple array, and during the debugging phase there was an issue in that Tuples can not be modified the same way that lists are, so I rectified this by converting array E into a list by name of C.

I want to try learning how to add a linear search. This is a method finding values in a list, and will be the first case where I use the input function.The function works, easy enough, but I wnat to have some fun with it and randomize everything I can possible do.For the sake of simplicity of this linear search, all numbers should probabaly be in the form of an integer, otherwise the probability of the query outpuuting positive would severly decrease. I have randomised the queried number (between 1 and 10), the arrays contents (values between 1 and 10), and the array should vary in length between 1 and 15 integers - which could make for some interesting statistics regarding probability of the linear search returning yes over a large sample size.
